Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The system begins with preprocessing the TMDB movie dataset obtained from Kaggle. This involves cleaning the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting textual data into a consistent format. EDA is performed to gain insights into the data, such as understanding genre distributions, movie popularity, and release dates, which helps in feature selection and engineering.

Vectorization Using Bag of Words: For textual inputs such as movie titles, descriptions, and genres, vectorization is performed using the Bag of Words (BoW) method. This technique converts the textual data into numerical vectors that represent the frequency of each word in the documents. The resulting vectorized data provides a simplified representation of the movies, allowing for the calculation of similarities between them based on their textual features.

Model Building for Recommendations: The model building phase focuses on creating a content-based recommendation system using the vectorized features. By calculating the similarity between the vectorized representations of movies, the system can recommend movies that are similar in content to those that a user has liked or selected. This approach leverages the semantic similarities captured by the BoW vectors, ensuring that recommendations are based on the content features of the movies.
